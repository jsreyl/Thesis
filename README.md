Statistical Mechanics for monodisperse granular materials
These codes use the LIGGGHTS software to generate a granular material distribution and realize experiments on it.
Additionally the voro++ library is used to calculate Voronoi cells of the distribution.
Thanks to professor William Oquendo for his support on post processing LIGGGHTS files.
